IT-IMMUNOPATHOGENESIS THEORY: Foundation Model-Based Single-Cell Analysis
================================================================================

CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS:
The IT (Immune Tolerant) phase of chronic HBV infection is characterized by
a unique immunological landscape with three core features:

1. NK CELL DEPLETION
   - Mechanism: HBsAg → IL-15Rβ downregulation → mTOR suppression
   - Evidence: Clusters 15, 18 (NL-dominant) show log2OR < -3 in IT
   - Biological impact: Loss of innate immune surveillance

2. METABOLIC REPROGRAMMING  
   - Mechanism: OXPHOS↑ + Glycolysis↓ in IT-exclusive cells
   - Evidence: Cluster 9 KEGG enrichment for oxidative phosphorylation
   - Biological impact: Cellular quiescence, reduced effector function

3. T CELL FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENT
   - Mechanism: Chronic antigen exposure → exhaustion/tolerance
   - Evidence: Clusters 20, 22, 23 elevated in IT phase
   - Biological impact: Failed viral clearance, immune tolerance

DISEASE PROGRESSION MODEL:

  NL (Normal) → IT (Tolerant) → IA/AR (Active) → CR (Resolved)
      ↓              ↓              ↓               ↓
  Homeostasis   NK depletion    NK recovery    Autoimmune-like
                OXPHOS shift    Inflammation   Viral clearance
                T tolerance     T activation   Immune reactivation

THERAPEUTIC IMPLICATIONS:
1. IL-15 agonist therapy to restore NK function
2. Metabolic modulators to reverse OXPHOS-dependent quiescence  
3. Checkpoint inhibitors to reverse T cell exhaustion
4. Combination approach targeting multiple pathways
