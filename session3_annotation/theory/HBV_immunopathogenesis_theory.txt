HBV IMMUNOPATHOGENESIS MODEL: Foundation Model-Based Single-Cell Analysis
================================================================================

CENTRAL FINDING:
Chronic HBV infection progression is characterized by dynamic immune cell
redistribution, with NK cell depletion and compensatory adaptive immune
activation during viral clearance.

1. NK CELL PROGRESSIVE DEPLETION
   - NL: 34.4% → IT: 25.0% → IA: 15.1% → CR: 6.7%
   - Mechanism: HBsAg → IL-15Rβ↓ → mTOR suppression
   - Key clusters: C6, C10, C11, C18

2. IT-PHASE TOLEROGENIC ENVIRONMENT
   - C20 Monocytes expansion (Log2_OR = +2.50)
   - Immunosuppressive monocyte accumulation
   - Maintains viral persistence without liver damage

3. CR-PHASE EFFECTOR EXPLOSION
   - C9 CD4+ T cells (Log2_OR = -6.91 in IT vs others)
   - C14 B cells with autoimmune signatures
   - KEGG: GVHD, T1D, thyroiditis, allograft rejection
   - Metabolic shift: OXPHOS↑ for high effector demand

4. ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY COMPENSATES NK LOSS
   - NK depletion in CR (6.7%) compensated by:
   - CD4+ T cells (C9): OXPHOS-driven effector function
   - B cells (C14): Autoimmune-like antibody response
   - CD8+ T cells (C5, C8): Cytotoxic activity

DISEASE PROGRESSION MODEL:

  NL (Normal)  →  IT (Tolerant)  →  IA/AR (Active)  →  CR (Resolved)
      ↓               ↓                  ↓                  ↓
  NK: 34.4%       NK: 25.0%          NK: 15-23%         NK: 6.7%
  Homeostasis    Tolerance         Inflammation      Viral clearance
                 C20 Mono↑         Liver damage      C9,C14 explosion
                                                     Autoimmune sig↑

THERAPEUTIC IMPLICATIONS:
1. IT phase: IL-15 agonist to restore NK function
2. IT phase: Target tolerogenic monocytes (C20)
3. CR transition: Monitor autoimmune complications
4. Combination: NK restoration + checkpoint inhibitors
